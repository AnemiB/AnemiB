## 🫧 About Me 🫧
I’m a third-year **Interactive Development (DV)** student also majoring in **User Experience (UX)** at **Open Window**. I’m passionate about using design and technology to build impactful, user-centered digital experiences.

</br>

## 🎮 What Drives Me 🎮
My interests span **gaming**, **design**, and **art**, and I’m especially inspired by the potential to merge these fields to create innovative digital solutions. I thrive in exploring interactive systems, crafting intuitive user interfaces, and bringing creative ideas to life.

</br>

## 💫 Current Studies and Focus 💫
As a DV and UX major, my academic journey has led me to develop a strong foundation in designing applications and websites with intuitive interfaces, rich features, and a solid technical backbone. This year, I’ve worked on several projects where I tackled complex challenges in usability, accessibility, and user engagement, continuously refining my skills as both a developer and a designer.

</br>

## 🐠 Fun Fact 🐠
When I’m not working on a new project, I’m likely finding inspiration in a game, experimenting with digital art, or learning the latest UX trends. I love tackling creative challenges and am always eager to learn something new!

## Semester 1 (Term 1 & 2): 🌟 [Aureum Elegance](https://github.com/Tsebo200/Aureum-Elegance-Frontend) 🌟
- **Description:**  
  Aureum Elegance is a full-stack warehouse management system tailored for the perfume industry. It centralises inventory, batch tracking, production workflows and analytics into a polished desktop/web app.

- **Problem Statement:**  
  Perfume warehouses face fragile packaging, perishable ingredients and complex batch/expiry tracking. Teams often rely on fragmented tools that hurt traceability and slow production. Aureum Elegance centralises stock, production recipes, deliveries, and alerts to reduce waste, improve traceability and speed up operations.

- **Highlights:**
  - Batch tracking with expiry logic and lot management to reduce recalls and waste.  
  - Real-time low-stock alerts (SignalR) for immediate operational awareness.  
  - Full production workflow: create fragrance recipes → produce batches → finished product tracking.  
  - JWT role-based auth + built-in 2FA, API documented with Swagger.  
  - Cross-platform desktop packaging with Electron and auto-update capability.

## Term 3: 🫗 [SipStop](https://github.com/AnemiB/SipStop) 🫗
- **Description:**  
  SipStop is a compassionate sobriety companion app built with Expo (React Native + TypeScript) and Firebase. It helps users track sober streaks, log drink events quickly, reflect with mood-tagged notes, and connect with a small support community.

- **Problem Statement:**  
  People reducing alcohol intake need a low-friction, non-judgmental tool to log events, reflect on moods and access encouragement. Heavy or clinical trackers can demotivate; SipStop provides fast logging, dynamic encouragement and community support to form sustainable habits.

- **Highlights:**
  - Fast drink logging and a sober-time tracker (time since last drink).  
  - Mood-tagged reflection notes using SVG icons and a dynamic encouragement engine.  
  - Community feed for public notes and comments.  
  - Real-time updates with Firestore listeners; built with Expo for cross-platform mobile use.

- **Highlights:**
