</br>

## 💫 Current Studies and Focus 💫
As a DV and UX major, my academic journey has led me to develop a strong foundation in designing applications and websites with intuitive interfaces, rich features, and a solid technical backbone. This year, I’ve worked on several projects where I tackled complex challenges in usability, accessibility, and user engagement, continuously refining my skills as both a developer and a designer.
