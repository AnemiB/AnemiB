## 🫧 About Me 🫧
I’m a third-year **Interactive Development (DV)** student also majoring in **User Experience (UX)** at **Open Window**. I’m passionate about using design and technology to build impactful, user-centered digital experiences.

</br>

## 🎮 What Drives Me 🎮
My interests span **gaming**, **design**, and **art**, and I’m especially inspired by the potential to merge these fields to create innovative digital solutions. I thrive in exploring interactive systems, crafting intuitive user interfaces, and bringing creative ideas to life.

</br>

## 💫 Current Studies and Focus 💫
As a DV and UX major, my academic journey has led me to develop a strong foundation in designing applications and websites with intuitive interfaces, rich features, and a solid technical backbone. This year, I’ve worked on several projects where I tackled complex challenges in usability, accessibility, and user engagement, continuously refining my skills as both a developer and a designer.

</br>

## 🐠 Fun Fact 🐠
When I’m not working on a new project, I’m likely finding inspiration in a game, experimenting with digital art, or learning the latest UX trends. I love tackling creative challenges and am always eager to learn something new!

## Term 1: 🌸 [Aureum Elegance (Fragrance WMS)](https://github.com/Tsebo200/Aureum-Elegance-Frontend) 🌸
- **Description:**
  <p>Aureum Elegance is a full-stack warehouse management system tailored to the perfume industry. It consolidates inventory, batch tracking, production recipes and analytics into a polished desktop/web app (React + TypeScript frontend, .NET Core backend, PostgreSQL) with Electron packaging for in-warehouse use.</p>

</br>

- **Problem Statement:**
  <p>Perfume warehousing presents unique challenges — fragile packaging, perishable fragrance ingredients and complex batch/expiry tracking — while teams often rely on fragmented tools that reduce traceability and slow production. Aureum Elegance centralizes stock, recipes, deliveries and alerts to enforce batch tracking, expiry management and role-based controls, improving traceability and reducing waste.</p>

</br>

- **Highlights:**
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Batch tracking & expiry logic:</strong> Lot numbers and expiry-aware workflows to reduce recalls and waste.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-time low-stock alerts:</strong> SignalR-powered notifications for instant operational response.</li>
    <li><strong>Production workflow:</strong> Fragrance recipes → produce batches → finished product tracking with ingredient & packaging management.</li>
    <li><strong>Secure role-based access:</strong> JWT auth with admin/employee role policies and built-in 2FA (no external provider).</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-platform desktop:</strong> Electron packaging with auto-update support for warehouse deployments.</li>
  </ul>

## Term 3: 🍷 [SipStop](https://github.com/AnemiB/SipStop) 🍷
- **Description:**
  <p>SipStop is a lightweight, empathetic sobriety companion app built with Expo (React Native + TypeScript) and Firebase. It helps users track sober streaks, log drinks quickly, reflect with mood-tagged notes, and connect with a small supportive community.</p>

</br>

- **Problem Statement:**
  <p>People trying to reduce alcohol intake need a simple, non-judgmental tool that fits into daily life — faster than a journal, warmer than a timer, and more social than a solitary tracker. Many existing solutions feel heavy or clinical; SipStop prioritizes instant logging, mood-based reflection and community encouragement so users can build sustainable habits through lightweight daily interactions.</p>

</br>

- **Highlights:**
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fast logging:</strong> Low-friction drink events and note creation for on-the-go use.</li>
    <li><strong>Sober time tracker:</strong> Time-since-last-drink display with adaptive encouragement messages.</li>
    <li><strong>Mood-tagged reflection:</strong> SVG emoji mood tags for expressive notes and personal reflection.</li>
    <li><strong>Community feed:</strong> Browse public notes and leave supportive comments.</li>
    <li><strong>Realtime updates:</strong> Firebase Firestore listeners ensure instant data sync.</li>
  </ul>
